    <h3>Couscous:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups couscous</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons harissa</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to release browned bits. Return mutton chops and chicken to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover; add turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium; simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir potatoes, turnips, and carrots into the pot. Simmer, covered, until vegetables start to soften, about 10 minutes. Mix in tomato paste and ras el hanout; cook for 10 minutes. Stir in chickpeas, zucchini, and cilantro; continue cooking, covered, until zucchini is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Bring 3 cups water to a boil in a saucepan; remove from heat and stir in couscous and butter. Cover saucepan and let stand until water is absorbed completely, 5 to 10 minutes. Fluff couscous with a fork and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Transfer to a serving dish.</li>
    <li>Ladle 2 scoops of cooking liquid into a bowl; mix in harissa until smooth.</li>
    <li>Scoop vegetables onto a serving plate. Scoop mutton and chicken onto a separate plate. Serve alongside couscous, harissa sauce, and remaining cooking liquid in the pot.</li>
